                    With over 170,000 hectares of vineyard stretched throughout four major Australian wine regions-
                    Western Australia, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia- Australia was able to secure
                    a spot as the top 7th among the world's top wine-producing nations. Each region offers a varieties
                    of wines and wine tourism experiences. Asutralia's wine sector emphasises on their variety of grapes
                    unlike other countries where their wines are an expression of the specific soil and climate of the country.

                        From the map, we are able to see that Victoria and New South Wales cover a larger area for 
                        the land used for vineyards. However, in terms of production, South Australia has the 
                        largest amount of wine produced, with Victoria and New South Wales coming in close second and third for wine production.<br>

                        The total production volume shows fluctuations throughout the years, indicating 
                        variability in wine production capacity or yield perhaps due to economical factors 
                        or environemntal factors. From the graph, we can see that there's a higher prodution volume
                        of red wine due to its popularity over the recent years. Moreover, in terms of grape variety, 
                        most vineyards seems to produce wine using 'Shiraz', 'Chardonnay', and 'Cabernet Sauvignon'grapes.
